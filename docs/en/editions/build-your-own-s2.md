# Build your own S2

When you clone the S2 Framework, you get full control over styles, allowing you to customize it to your design. You can add your elements and styles. Feel free to remove elements, demos, components, or pages that aren't necessary for your project.



**If you decide to use the Full Edition:**

1. Make the **"Home"** page your homepage, and remove the `DELETE-ME` element from the page.
2. As the cover page of the style guide will become "Old Home", you may also delete it.
3. Delete the **"One-page Style Guide"** page (everything is already included in the Full Edition).
4. Delete the **"License"** page (optional)



**S2 is well-optimized for performance** — The S2 Framework is lightweight and optimized for speed, SEO, and accessibility. If you're looking for a more streamlined version, you may consider these two **Editions**.

To remove everything except a one-page Style Guide:

{% content-ref url="one-page-style-guide.md" %}
[one-page-style-guide.md](one-page-style-guide.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

Just keep some of the best parts:

{% content-ref url="lite-edition.md" %}
[lite-edition.md](lite-edition.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}
