# Build your own S2

When you clone the S2 Framework, you get full control over styles, allowing you to customize it to your design. You can add your elements and styles. You can also remove elements, demos, components or pages that aren't necessary for your project.



**S2 is well-optimized for performance** â€” The S2 Framework is lightweight and optimized for speed, SEO, and accessibility. However, if you're looking for an even more streamlined version, you may consider these two **Editions** we suggest:



To remove everything except a one-page Style Guide:

{% content-ref url="one-page-style-guide.md" %}
[one-page-style-guide.md](one-page-style-guide.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}



Just keeps the best parts we recommend:

{% content-ref url="lite-edition.md" %}
[lite-edition.md](lite-edition.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}
