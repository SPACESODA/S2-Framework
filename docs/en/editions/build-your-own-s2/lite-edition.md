# Lite Edition

**Follow these steps to create a Lite Edition of S2:**

1. Delete these pages:
   * **"S2 Components"** page
   * **"For Drafting"** page
   * Reference Pages, including:
     * The **"One-page Style Guide"** page
     * The **"Licenses"** page
2. Go to the **"Layouts"** page:
   * Remove the **Grid Layout Utilities** section
3. Make the **"Home"** page your homepage:
   * Remove `DELETE-ME` from the Home page
   * As the cover page of the style guide will become "Old Home", you can also delete it.
4. Clean up all unused **Components**, _except_:
   * <mark style="color:green;">**Global Code**</mark>
   * <mark style="color:green;">**- Framework Base CSS**</mark>
   * <mark style="color:green;">**- Icon Libraries**</mark>
5. Clean up all unused interactions.
6. Clean up all unused styles.
