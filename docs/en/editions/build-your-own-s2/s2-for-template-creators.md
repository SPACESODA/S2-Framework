# One-page Style Guide

{% hint style="info" %}
Are you a template creator? Since Webflow _**does not**_**&#x20;allow custom code** to be embedded in templates, this one-page version is perfect for you. It is essentially a **one-page Style Guide** that fully complies with Webflowâ€™s marketplace submission [requirements](https://webflow.com/templates/submission-guidelines), making your template creation process faster, more organized, scalable, and easy to maintain for anyone.
{% endhint %}



**Let's follow these steps:**

1. Go to **Site settings**, then **Custom code**, and remove all the code from the global **Head code** and **Footer code**. Remember to click "Save".
2. Open Designer, make the **"Home"** page your homepage, and remove `DELETE-ME` from the page.
3. Delete all pages, _**except**_:
   * Your new blank homepage
   * The **"One-page Style Guide"** page
   * The **"Licenses"** page
   * The **"Password"** and **"404"** pages
4. Remove the <mark style="color:green;">**Global Code**</mark> component on the **"Password"** and **"404"** pages.
5. Go to the **"One-page Style Guide"** page and remove the <mark style="color:green;">**S2: Clone Now CTA**</mark> component. The <mark style="color:green;">**Grid Guide**</mark> component also consists of custom code, but you may keep it as a tool and remove it later.
6. _Optional_: Remove **Dark mode** from the **Colors** variable collection.
7. Clean up all unused **Components**.
8. Clean up all unused interactions.
9. Clean up all unused styles.
