# Build your Own

When you clone the S2 Framework, you get full control over styles, allowing you to customize your design from the start. You can remove elements, demos, components or pages that aren't necessary for your project.

**Optimized for performance**

The S2 Framework is lightweight and optimized for speed, SEO, and accessibility. However, if you're looking for an even lighter version, choose from these two **Editions**:

### S2 Lite

Keep the essential parts we recommend.

{% content-ref url="s2-framework-lite.md" %}
[s2-framework-lite.md](s2-framework-lite.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### S2 for Templates

Remove everything except a one-page Style Guide.

{% content-ref url="s2-for-template-creators.md" %}
[s2-for-template-creators.md](s2-for-template-creators.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}
