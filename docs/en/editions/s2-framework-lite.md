# S2 Framework Lite

**Follow these steps to create a Lite Edition of S2:**

1. Delete these pages:
   * **"Filter UI"** page
   * **"S2 Components"** page
   * **"For Drafting"** page
2. Go to the **"Layouts"** page:
   * Remove **Filter UI**, and **S2 Components** nav links.
   * Remove the **Grid Layout Utilities** section.
3. Make the **"Home"** page your homepage:
   * Remove `DELETE-ME` from the Home page.
   * As the cover page of the style guide will become "Old Home", you can also delete that page.
4. Clean up all unused **Components**, _except_:
   * <mark style="color:green;">**Global Code**</mark>
   * <mark style="color:green;">**- Framework Base CSS**</mark>
   * <mark style="color:green;">**- Icon Libraries**</mark>
5. Clean up all unused interactions.
6. Clean up all unused styles.

We recommend keeping the style guide intact until you've completed most of your website design. The handcrafted styles and layouts in the Framework can be incredibly useful throughout your project. ðŸ˜Š
