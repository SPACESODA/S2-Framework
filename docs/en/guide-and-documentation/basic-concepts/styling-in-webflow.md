# Styling in Webflow

## Basic Concepts

Understanding the basic concepts below is essential for building and customizing your Webflow projects.

## When to use S2 Attributes?

* When you want to apply styles or functions to an element in a **single location** or for a **one-time purpose**.
* When you want to avoid creating a new combo class that would be rarely reused.
* When existing combo classes on an element are already complex and potentially confusing.

Focus on your creativity and enjoy Webflow's flexibility. Use attributes that you remember and fully understand. No pressure!

## Guide to Making Styling Choices

Not sure whether to use Classes, Attributes, or Utility Classes? Follow this priority-based approach to make the best styling decisions:

**Priority 1:**\
Use existing **Element Classes** and **Combo Classes** from the S2 Framework.

**Priority 2:**\
Create and use your **classes**.

**Priority 3:**\
Use **S2 Attributes** that you understand and can easily remember.

**Priority 4:**\
Use the framework's **Utility Classes**.

## Should I create new Attributes?

Attributes are powerful tools. **However, attributes cannot be searched directly in any Webflow panels. When you want to rename something, there is also no way to update all instances quickly.**

**Attributes can never satisfy all styling needs.** Setting up too many attributes that are not carefully planned can also lead to huge confusion easily. We are not here to reinvent CSS or build a CSS utility framework like Tailwind.

Therefore, we recommend following the above [#guide-to-making-styling-choices](styling-in-webflow.md#guide-to-making-styling-choices "mention") and sticking with the framework's official and standardized **S2 Attributes**.

If you really want to create new custom attributes, place them in the `css_custom` code embed inside the <mark style="color:green;">**Global Code**</mark> component. Avoid creating too many custom attributes.
