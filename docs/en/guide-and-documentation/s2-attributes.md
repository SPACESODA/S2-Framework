# S2 Attributes

**S2 Attributes â€” easy-to-use and powerful attributes to help you work faster.**

S2 Attributes is a lightweight library of pre-defined attributes. The concept is similar to utility classes in Tailwind CSS but tailored for Webflow in the form of **attributes**.

Take `[opacity="1"]` as an example, when applying this attribute to an element on the Designer panel, `opacity` is the attribute name and `1` is the attribute value.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Attributes can exist without a value.** However, in some cases, **custom elements** and elements within them require attributes to have a value. We can type in something like `true` and it should work fine.

### Learning S2 Attributes

The best way to understand attributes is to read the CSS, visit:

[https://github.com/SPACESODA/S2-Framework/blob/main/webflow/css/s2-attributes.css](../../../webflow/css/s2-attributes.css)

{% hint style="info" %}
The codes on the GitHub repository can be a bit behind the latest version of the framework.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
**We strongly recommend that you DO NOT add new attributes to the S2 Attributes nor rename any attributes.** If the S2 Attributes do not perfectly match your desired style, create combo classes or use utility classes to style instead.
