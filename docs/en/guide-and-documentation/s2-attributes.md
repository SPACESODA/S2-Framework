# S2 Attributes

**S2 Attributes â€” easy-to-use and powerful attributes to help you work faster.**

**S2 Attributes is a lightweight library of pre-defined attributes.** The concept is similar to utility classes in Tailwind CSS but tailored for Webflow in the form of **attributes**.

Take `[opacity="1"]` as an example, when applying this attribute to an element on the Designer panel, `opacity` is the attribute name and `1` is the attribute value.

### Learning S2 Attributes

The best way to understand attributes is to read the CSS, visit:

[https://github.com/SPACESODA/S2-Framework/blob/main/webflow/css/s2-attributes.css](../../../webflow/css/s2-attributes.css)

{% hint style="info" %}
**Attributes can exist without a value.** However, in some cases, **custom elements** and elements within them require attributes to have a value. We can type in something like `true` in the value and it should work fine.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Do not modify S2 Attributes!**

**We strongly recommend that you do not add new attributes to S2 Attributes or rename existing ones.** If S2 Attributes do not perfectly match your desired style, we suggest using combo classes or utility classes instead.
{% endhint %}
