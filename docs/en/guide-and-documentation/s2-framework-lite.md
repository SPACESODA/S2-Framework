# S2 Framework Lite

The S2 Framework is lightweight and optimized for speed, SEO, and accessibility. However, if you are looking for an even lighter version, there are options:

1. **S2 Lite**: Keep the essential parts we recommend.
2. **S2 for Templates**: [Remove everything except a one-page Style Guide](for-template-creators.md).

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you want to minimize the footprint of the S2 Framework, we generally recommend slimming down the style guide after you have completed most of your website design. The handcrafted styles and layouts in the Framework are always handy while you work on your project. ðŸ˜Š
{% endhint %}



## Steps to prepare a Lite version of the S2 Framework

**Follow these steps to create a Lite version of our recommendation:**

1. Delete these pages:
   * **"Filter UI"** page
   * **"S2 Components"** page
   * **"For Drafting"** page
2. Go to the **"Layouts"** page:
   * Remove **Filter UI**, and **S2 Components** nav links.
   * remove the **Grid Layout Utilities** section.
3. Make the **"Home"** page your homepage:
   * Remove `DELETE-ME` from the Home page.
   * As the cover page of the style guide will become "Old Home", you can also delete that page.
4. Clean up all unused **Components**, _except_:
   * <mark style="color:green;">**Global Code**</mark>
   * <mark style="color:green;">**+ S2 Framework Base CSS**</mark>
   * <mark style="color:green;">**+ Icon Libraries**</mark>
5. Clean up all unused interactions.
6. Clean up all unused styles.
