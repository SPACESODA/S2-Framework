# Colors vs Palettes

Instead of applying colors from palettes to classes each of the time, we suggest using **Colors** variables whenever possible. The names of **Colors** usually specify their roles or purposes, and the names of **Palettes** describe the colors.



## Colors ðŸ–Œ

The **Colors**, **Colors: Extended** and **Colors: Special** variable groups inside the default variable collection are the core color options for your project.

The Colors variables have **Base mode** (the Base mode is "Light" mode by default) and **Dark mode** setup. By using **Colors**, you can easily update the entire color scheme of your site anytime.,&#x20;

The Primary, Secondary, Accent, and Neutral colors follow a 12-step tint setup.

For the extended colors, you can modify, add, or rename them to align with your brand.

{% hint style="info" %}
You can remove the **Dark mode** from **Colors** completely if your website does not have light and dark modes.
{% endhint %}



## Palettes :art:

Palettes are groups or sets of colors, including collections of tint variations of tints.

**Palettes** variables can be selected by **Colors** variables. This method provides flexibility to update colors by choosing from palette variables without disrupting the site's overall style.

**Colors** variables reference **Palettes** variables, giving you the flexibility to update colors by selecting from palettes easily without disrupting the site's overall style.

**S2's Palettes** (the "**Lightness Minimum**" of our default colors are set to **15**)**:**\

{% hint style="danger" %}
Please keep the name **"Neutral"** and all **Neutral colors' variable names** unchanged.
