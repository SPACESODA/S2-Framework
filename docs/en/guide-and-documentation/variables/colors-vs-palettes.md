# Colors vs Palettes

Instead of applying colors from palettes to classes each of the time, we suggest using **Colors** variables whenever possible. The names of **Colors** usually specify their roles or purposes, and the names of **Palettes** describe the colors.



## Colors

**Colors** and **Colors: Special** variable groups inside the variable collection **Colors (default)** are the primary color options for your project.

You can add more of your brand colors. For simplicity, only the Primary color includes predefined variations: Primary Light and Primary Deep.

The Colors variables have Base mode and Dark mode setup By using **Colors**, you can easily update the entire color scheme of your site anytime.

{% hint style="info" %}
You can remove the **Dark mode** from **Colors** completely if your website does not have light and dark modes.
{% endhint %}



## Palettes :art:

Palettes are groups of colors that are usually sets of tint colors.

The core palettes **Primary**, **Secondary**, **Accent**, and **Neutral** have 12-step tints by default in the S2 Frameworks in form of Variable Groups.

**Palettes** variables can be selected by **Colors** variables. This method provides flexibility to update colors by choosing from palette variables without disrupting the site's overall style.



**S2's Palettes** (the "**Lightness Minimum**" of our default colors are set to **15**)**:**

{% hint style="danger" %}
Please leave the name **"Neutral"** and all Neutral colors' **variable names** unchanged.
{% endhint %}
