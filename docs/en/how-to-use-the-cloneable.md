<summary>Do I need to design on the Page Template now?</summary>

No, you don't need to do so at the beginning.

Designing a large page inside a component can be inconvenient.

You can begin designing by unlinking the <mark style="color:green;">**Page Template**</mark> component on any blank page. Once your layouts are more consolidated, you can copy and paste the parts back to the <mark style="color:green;">**Page Template**</mark> component later.
