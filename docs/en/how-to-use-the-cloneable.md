# How to use the Cloneable?

## Basic Steps

After [**cloning**](https://s2-framework.webflow.io/?utm_source=gitbook\&utm_medium=docs\&utm_campaign=s2) the S2 Framework to your Webflow account, you may follow these steps:

1. **Set up your Homepage**
   1. Make the page **Home** your homepage.
   2. Delete the S2 Framework Cover page.
   3. Remove the `DELETE-ME` section on your new homepage.
2. **Configure the Variables**
   * Set up the colors of your Palettes in the Variables panel.
   * Configure other variables, such as Font Family.
3. **Start building!**
   * Add the <mark style="color:green;">**Page Template**</mark> component to your **Home**, or use the **New Page Template** to create a new page.
   * Unlink the <mark style="color:green;">**Page Template**</mark> component instance and begin building.

<summary>Do I have to update the design on the Page Template first?</summary>

Designing a full page directly inside a component can be inconvenient.

Instead, you can start by building your layout outside the component. Once everything is more finalized, copy and paste those sections and elements back into the Page Template component.

<summary>Do I need to configure all variables before building?</summary>

Not necessarily. You can start building with the default values and adjust variables later. However, if you already have a solid design, it is a good idea to set up your palette and font variables upfront.
