# Foundations of S2

S2 combines the best ideas from [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) and other frameworks. S2 also incorporated features from some remarkable frameworks. They are improved in S2 and eventually become unique and powerful.

<table data-column-title-hidden data-view="cards"><thead><tr><th>Frameworks / UI Kits</th><th>What we think</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Saddle Framework</strong></td><td>We initially built S2 for our own use on top of the <a href="https://saddle-framework.webflow.io/">Saddle Framework</a> (partly inspired by <a href="https://www.nocodesupply.co/mast">MAST</a>). Over time, we added numerous modifications and improvements, establishing our conventions. Now, S2 has developed its own distinct standard.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Lumos</strong></td><td>We adopted some of the best parts and concepts from <a href="https://webflow.com/made-in-webflow/website/lumos-v2-beta">Lumos</a> (<a href="https://lumos.timothyricks.com/">Docs</a>) by Timothy Ricks and simplified them. While Lumos is magical, it can be too hacky for most people and especially the clients.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Filter UI Kit</strong></td><td>Finsweet's <a href="https://finsweet.com/attributes/cms-filter">CMS Filter</a> is super powerful. But its <a href="https://accessible-filter-ui-kit.webflow.io/">Filter UI Kit</a> comes with numerous design issues and usability bugs. We provide a refined version of the kit, ensuring full compatibility with CMS Filter and S2.</td></tr></tbody></table>



We drew inspiration and borrowed best practices from several other popular frameworks. Each of the below contributed methodologies that enhanced the versatility and functionality of the S2 Framework.
