# Foundations of S2

We initially built S2 for our own agency's use based on the [Saddle Framework](https://saddle-framework.webflow.io/) (which is inspired by [MAST](https://www.nocodesupply.co/mast)). Over time, we added numerous modifications and improvements, establishing our conventions. Now, S2 has developed its own distinct standard.

S2 combines the best ideas from [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) and other frameworks. S2 also incorporated features from some remarkable frameworks. They are improved in S2 and eventually become unique and powerful.

We drew inspiration and borrowed best practices from several other popular frameworks. They contributed methodologies that enhanced the versatility and functionality of the S2 Framework.
