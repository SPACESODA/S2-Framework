# Getting Started

**The S2 Framework is designed for everyone, whether you are a professional, a designer, or a marketer.** S2 aims to be accessible to anyone with basic HTML + CSS skills and a fundamental understanding of Webflow.

### <mark style="color:blue;">When building the S2 Framework, our goal was to make it practical and easy to use with minimal friction. Focus on learning Webflow and basic CSS concepts — with that foundation, S2 feels straightforward and powerful.</mark>



Get familiar with the framework in just one or two hours!

:smile: **Step 1. Read the Docs (\~30mins)**

:laughing: **Step 2. Hands-on experimentation (\~30mins)**

> Immerse yourself in the S2 Framework and explore its components. Use this docs as a guide as you familiarize yourself with each part. Experiment and get your hands dirty.
>
> Explore in [Read-only mode](https://s2-framework.webflow.io/#preview).

:trumpet: **Step 3. Use the S2 cloneable to start building anything**
