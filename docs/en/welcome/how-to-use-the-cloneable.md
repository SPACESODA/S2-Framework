# How to use the Cloneable?

When you clone the S2 Framework, you get full control over styles, allowing you to customize it to your design. You can add your elements and styles. Feel free to remove elements, demos, components, or pages that aren't necessary for your project.



## Full Edition vs. One-page Edition

| Full Edition                                     | One-page                                                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <p>Everything + </p><p>Ready-made Components</p> | A one-page style guide for your further customization as you build your site |
| Has custom codes                                 | NO custom code                                                               |

**If you decide to use the Full Edition:**

1. Make the **"Home"** page your homepage, and remove the `DELETE-ME` element from the page.
2. As the cover page of the style guide will become "Old Home", you may also delete it.
3. Delete the **"One-page Style Guide"** page (everything is already included in the Full Edition).
4. Delete the **"License"** page (optional)

**Components?** We prepared a small collection of carefully crafted layout components in the cloneable. Such layouts and components have not yet been converted into Webflow Components, allowing you to customize or remove them as needed easily.

**One-page Style Guide:**

If you want a style guide without custom codes, follow [these steps](one-page-style-guide.md) to clean up your cloneable.



### Next?

1. **Delete the S2 Framework Cover page**
2. **Configure the Variables**
3. **Start building:** Add the <mark style="color:green;">**Page Template**</mark> component to your **Home**, unlink it, and you are good to go!



### Do I need to configure all variables before building?

Not necessarily. You can start building with the default values and adjust variables later. However, if you already have a solid design concept, it is a good idea to set up your palette and font variables upfront.
